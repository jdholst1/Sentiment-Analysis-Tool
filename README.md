# Public Sentiment Analysis Tool
This project is designed to gather data on public sentiment for or against an idea and summarize the results.

The idea is to collect data from big social media platforms such as Facebook or YouTube through use of APIs.
Then, clean up and sort the data; which is a process I'll figure out when I see what format the data arrives in.
Next is to process the data with a custom-made RNN.
The results will then be displayed. The format this will take will depend on the data. For instance, if it works out best to report the most common words in describing a topic, then charts would make for good visualization. The more time I have left at the end, the more user-friendly interface I could implement.


To run the frontend, go to the frontend directory in a terminal and run "npm start".
For the backend, go to its respective directory and type "python app.py".
