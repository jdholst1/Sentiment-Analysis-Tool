# Sentiment Analysis Tool
This application features a machine learning model that takes a prompt and gives an assessment of the sentiment analysis. That will start with a score of positivity vs. negativity. As progress goes on, I hope to implement the feature to report on most-used words, and ideally also the words or phrases that carried the most weight in deciding those numbers. Visualizations may also later include charts made around these metrics.

The initial idea was to gather the data from social media platforms like X or Facebook using either web-scraping or APIs, based on a search prompt. Most if not all of the platforms have a dark gray area for accessing data legitimately through web-scraping, and API token accessibility is a different process each time, with its own limitations each time, so that aspect of the projet has taken the back-burner and is now a nice-to-have feature if I can figure something out.
